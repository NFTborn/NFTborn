- 👋 Hi, I’m @NFTborn
- 👀 I’m interested in the development and production of the blockchain, focusing on NFT creation, Marketplace creation, unique coin creation, and market data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding and UX design. As well as implementing my current business, marketing, and artistic abilities in the blockchain.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating NFT projects, by means of creating NFT collectables, creating utilities for those collectables, creating marketplaces, and finally creating P2E games.
- 📫 How to reach me quickest would be to email me directly at nftborn@gmail.com or DM. Discord @KingBorn#8564
